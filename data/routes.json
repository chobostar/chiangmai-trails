You’ll see the post while running downhill.\n\n- There is a cafe for breakfast before or after the workout.\n- There is also a 7-Eleven not far from the start, so you can get drinks after each loop.",

I hiked it anti-clockwise and spent a lot of time descending to the waterfall; I would recommend going clockwise instead. Beware of dogs — some of them are not friendly! There is a village where you can buy drinks and instant noodles. The forest near the top is so quiet and beautiful; if the weather is good, you can see a perfect view of Chiang Dao mountain.",
